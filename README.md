## Description
- Our motivation for this project was launched after a discussion about connecting with each other, and our classmates, after our boot camp has ended. We aimed to build an application where developers could connect and further build on their skills. We also wanted to provide a welcoming space for developers of all levels to collobrate and the classification for developers as either a mentor, collobrator or study buddy, was introduced. 
- Challenges...
- Initially their were challenges organizing the file structure and creating the front-end with React. How to set the components and routes 
- Future development...
- Further work on front-end styling in React and possibly implementing another styling library, such as Material UI.   
- reviews ?
- a message box for questions (similar to an AI chatbox...), payment stripe (option to add tips for everybody and/or mentors who want to provide services for a fee?). 
- We learned...

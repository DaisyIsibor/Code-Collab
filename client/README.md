## Description
- Our motivation for this project was launched after a discussion about connecting with each other, and our classmates, after our boot camp has ended. We aimed to build an application where developers could connect and futher build on their skills. We also wanted to provide a welcoming space for developers of all levels to collobrate and the classification for developers as either a mentor, collobrator or study buddy was born.
